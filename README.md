## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **PythonExpenseApp/**: Main application package
  - `main.py`: Entry point, handles login and dashboard routing
  - `db_connection.py`: Database connectivity
  - `student.py`, `activity.py`, `expense.py`, `feedback.py`, `statistics.py`: Core logic
  - `gui/`: All GUI modules (student and teacher dashboards, login, etc.)
- **Role-based Routing**: Users are routed to different dashboards based on their role (student/teacher)

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

- **students**: Stores both students and teachers, with a `role` field.
- **activities**: All trip activities, with schedule and capacity info.
- **student_activities**: Junction table for student enrollments, with a constraint to prevent teacher participation.
- **expenses**: Tracks all trip-related expenses.
- **debts**: Tracks who owes whom and how much.
- **feedback**: Stores feedback and ratings for activities.

**Key Integrity Constraint:**
```sql
CONSTRAINT check_student_role CHECK (
    (SELECT role FROM students WHERE id = student_id) = 'student'
)
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database Connection Errors**: Check MySQL service, credentials, and database existence.
- **Import Errors**: Run from the project root and activate your virtual environment.
- **GUI Display Issues**: Ensure Tkinter is installed (on Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`).
